# DoorLoop-API-Tools---Deleting-Account-Data

DoorLoop is an SAAS Platform with an open API. 

Using DoorLoop's Open API, this script will erase data for an Account using timed "GET" and "DELETE" requests to all publicly available endpoints in DoorLoop's API documentation. 

Sometimes, a business can grow or change dramatically, potentially making it necessary to "start over" and remove large amounts of data from the Platform. This script is designed to make this process easier.

For more information on DoorLoop's Open API, please refer to the Documentation provided here: https://api.doorloop.com/reference/intro/my-requests
